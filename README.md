# sandcastling

A testbed for automating GitHub issues with [`@ai-hero/sandcastle`](https://github.com/mattpocock/sandcastle).

`sandcastle` runs a coding agent (here: Claude Code) inside a disposable
Docker sandbox against a git worktree of this repo. `sandcastling` wraps
that with an orchestrator that takes a GitHub issue (or PRD with child
issues), drives implement → review → merge through one container per
issue, and fast-forwards the result onto your base branch — without ever
touching the host filesystem or shared branches.

## How it works

```

- **One container per issue.** The implementer and reviewer share a
  sandbox; on approval the container is released. Merge runs in its own
  short-lived sandbox.
- **The host branch never moves until the merger succeeds.** Landing is a
  compare-and-set fast-forward against the ref you started on; if it
  moved underneath, the merger output is preserved on a temp branch for
  manual recovery.
- **The orchestrator owns all GitHub state** — status moves, marker
  comments, closing issues, dropping blocking edges. Stages only commit
  code.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22 (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm 10.31.0 (auto-activated via Corepack)
- Docker running locally
- `gh` authenticated against the target repo
- An Anthropic API key

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .sandcastle/.env.example .sandcastle/.env
# then edit .sandcastle/.env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pnpm build:image      # builds the sandcastle:latest Docker image
```

### Run against an issue

```bash
pnpm sandcastle 42    # seed = issue #42 (single issue or a PRD)
```

The orchestrator will:

1. Resolve the seed and any child issues from the GitHub Project board.
2. Spin up one sandbox per issue against a fresh worktree on its branch.
3. Drive implement → review → (rework or) merge until done, capped by
   `tickCap` and `attemptCap`.
4. Fast-forward your base ref to the merger result and release the
   sandboxes.

A per-run transcript lands in `.sandcastle/logs/`.

```

The host project itself is intentionally minimal: TypeScript + Biome,
`chalk` so the agent has something to import, pnpm pinned via
`packageManager` in `package.json`.

## Useful scripts

| Command            | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm sandcastle N`| Run the orchestrator against issue / PRD `#N`             |
| `pnpm build:image` | (Re)build the sandbox Docker image                        |
| `pnpm clean`       | Drop the persistent `node_modules` / pnpm-store volumes   |
| `pnpm verify`      | `tsc --noEmit` + Biome `check` + `node --test`            |
| `pnpm lint` / `format` | Biome lint / format                                   |
| `pnpm test`        | Run the workflow / adapter unit tests                     |

## Tuning

- **Model, caps, transcript sink** — pass options to `runOrchestrator` in
  `.sandcastle/main.ts` (`tickCap`, `attemptCap`, `model`, `transcript`).
- **Stage behavior** — edit the relevant prompt under
  `.sandcastle/prompts/`. Behavior changes belong there, not in adapter
  code.
- **Workflow logic** — `.sandcastle/lib/manager/` is a pure
  observe-decide-act loop. Add phases / actions there; keep adapters
  (`gh`, `git`, Docker, Projects) in `orchestrator.ts` and friends.

---

## Known limitations

- Auth is API-key only. Subscription-based auth via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  is tracked upstream in
  [mattpocock/sandcastle#191](https://github.com/mattpocock/sandcastle/issues/191).
- The sandbox runs as UID 1000 (`agent`); the custom provider in
  `.sandcastle/lib/` exists to keep file ownership sane on bind mounts —
  see the design notes in `lib/docker.ts` and `lib/chown.ts` before
  changing it.
- One concurrent sandbox container per issue. Cross-issue parallelism is
  bounded by `tickCap` and the manager, not by Docker.

## For agents

Durable instructions for any agent (host or sandboxed) working in this
repo live in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). Stage-specific task prompts live
under `.sandcastle/prompts/`.
